I made 2 test using diffirent frameworks

Test 1 is From protractor 
Target Framework is jasmine
I was suppose to write the test script on a diffren framework but opt not to since your company is using protractor
This is the first time I made a test script using protractor
I included an image of the test result
line 63 I should have use the get attribute (value), but ended up doing somethiing else 
I was about to store the URL's into a variable but opt not to as i like seeing the url and knowing where am I in my script
This file is executable with protractor

Test 2 is made using C#
It's a cloud base kind of automation test it uses selenium as well
It needs the TP agent to run.

End
